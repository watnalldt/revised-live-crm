<h1 class="mi fs-4 text-center">Our Complaints Handling Policy</h1>
     <h6 class="text-center">Date published: March 2024 V5</h6>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
    <p>At Energy Portfolio, we work hard to maintain a very high standard of service for you as the Managing Agent and your client. We specialize within the RICS/ARMA sector, currently helping 145 Managing Agents in the UK manage over 22,500 electricity and gas meters.</p>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>Our Services</strong></h2>
    <p>We are a 'One Stop Shop' covering all aspects of both procurement and dealing with Electricity, Gas and Water suppliers for all day-to-day queries. Energy Portfolio is fully approved by the Energy Ombudsman Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) scheme, which officially goes live on December 1, 2022.</p>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>What We Are</strong></h2>
    <p>We are an 'energy broker', an intermediary providing the service of researching and securing energy deals for our clients (or more precisely for the owners of the properties that you manage).</p>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>Our Commitment</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We use reasonable care and skill in delivering our services.</li>
        <li>We make reasonable commercial efforts to meet agreed timescales.</li>
        <li>We strive to put things right quickly and effectively if you're unhappy with our services.</li>
    </ul>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>Contract Placement Process</strong></h2>
    <p>We obtain at least 3 comparable quotes before agreeing to a contract and only place contracts for a 12-month term to ensure full compliance with section 20.</p>

    <h2 class="fs-6">Residential Price Cap</h2>
    <p>The residential price cap only applies to domestic household supplies and doesn't protect our residential management clients. Energy supply meters for residential management companies are set up under a business account.</p>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>Our Policy</strong></h2>
    <p>We aim to change the way the Property Sector manages and procures utilities. We've created a process that allows you to easily raise concerns and have them dealt with swiftly.</p>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>How We Earn Money</strong></h2>
    <p>Energy Portfolio earns a commission directly from the energy supplier, included in pence per kWh and the standing charge.</p>

     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>Complaints Procedure</strong></h2>
     <h2 class="fs-6"><strong>Step 1</strong> - Making a complaint</h2>
